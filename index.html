                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! myself Ajit Ashwath, a dedicated sophomore in Computer Science and Engineering with a passion for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
                    With a consistent CGPA reflecting my commitment to academic excellence, I am actively shaping my career as an aspiring ML engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey in ML has been driven by a deep curiosity and a commitment to continual learning. I’ve immersed myself in this field through various "Coursera", "Udemy" and other esteemed certifications, focusing on Python and core ML concepts. 
                    Additionally, my hands-on experience with Python and C++ has been enriched by several noteworthy projects that showcase my practical skills and innovative approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside the realm of academics, I am an enthusiastic competitive programmer, engaging in platforms such as "Codeforces", "LeetCode", and "CodeChef" 
                    with an aim to refine my problem-solving abilities. My involvement as a member of the AI and Copywriting team in the Google Developer Student Club 
                    (GDSC) has provided me with invaluable insights and collaborative experiences in the tech community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my technical pursuits, I have a creative side as a music artist, primarily focusing on instrumental compositions. 
                    This creative outlet complements my resourceful and skillful nature. My background also includes marketing experience through an internship, where I developed valuable skills in marketing strategy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I’m excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities in the dynamic field of ML and AI.
                </p>
